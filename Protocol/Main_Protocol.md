## 5. Background and Rationale

Allergic diseases represent a significant global health burden, with increasing prevalence worldwide. In India, epidemiological data on allergies is limited, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. Tumkur district in Karnataka provides a unique setting for studying allergy epidemiology due to its diverse population, environmental factors, and healthcare access patterns.

Recent research has highlighted the role of microbiome dysbiosis and microplastic exposure in allergic diseases. Additionally, understanding quality of life, treatment perceptions, and comorbidities is crucial for comprehensive allergy management.

This study aims to fill critical knowledge gaps in allergy epidemiology in the Indian context, with specific focus on emerging environmental risk factors.

## 6. Objectives

### Primary Objectives:
1. To determine the prevalence of allergic diseases in the study population
2. To describe the distribution and phenotypes of allergic diseases
3. To identify determinants of allergic diseases

### Secondary Objectives:
4. To investigate temporal and spatial associations of allergic diseases
5. To assess the role of microbiome composition in allergic diseases
6. To evaluate microplastic exposure and its association with allergies
7. To assess quality of life among individuals with allergic diseases
8. To understand perceptions and practices related to allergy treatment
9. To identify comorbidities associated with allergic diseases
10. To explore other relevant environmental and lifestyle factors
